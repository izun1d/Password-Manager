Password Manager (EN)

A secure, local password manager for Windows built with C#. It provides robust, client-side encryption to ensure your sensitive data remains private and under your control. All data is encrypted locally using AES-256 and is only accessible with your master password.
Features

    Strong Encryption: Your data is encrypted with AES-256, protected by a master password derived using PBKDF2 for enhanced security.

    Local Storage: The encrypted vault is stored on your device, giving you full ownership of your data. You can even choose the location of the vault file.

    Account Recovery: An optional recovery key file can be generated to regain access if you forget your master password.

    Customization: Personalize the application with light/dark themes and a custom accent color.

    Multilingual: Switch between English and Ukrainian interfaces on the fly.

Getting Started

    Run the application.

    On the first launch, create a strong master password.

    (Optional but recommended) Generate and save the recovery key file in a safe, separate location (e.g., a USB drive).

    Log in with your master password to start adding and managing your accounts.
